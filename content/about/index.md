Hi! Currently I'm working as an alignment researcher at [Owain Evans' org](https://owainevans.github.io).
Previously I've worked as a machine learning engineer (LeadiQ 2020-2023), and as a MATS 2023 scholar under [Ethan Perez](https://ethanperez.net).
I enjoy making typesafe python packages such as [Slist](https://github.com/thejaminator/slist) on the side.

My research
- [Looking Inward: Language Models Can Learn About Themselves by Introspection](https://modelintrospection.com)
- [Bias-Augmented Consistency Training Reduces Biased Reasoning in Chain-of-Thought](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05518)

In progress
- Language Models Can Articulate Their Implicit Goals
