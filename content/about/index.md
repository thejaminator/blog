Hi! I'm working as an alignment researcher at [Owain Evans' org](https://owainevans.github.io).
Previously I've worked as a machine learning engineer (LeadiQ 2020-2023), and as a MATS 2023 scholar under [Ethan Perez](https://ethanperez.net).
I enjoy making typesafe python packages such as [Slist](https://github.com/thejaminator/slist) on the side.
